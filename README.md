## Azure account requirements

**IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need:

* **Azure account**. If you're new to Azure, [get an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-search/) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started. See [guide to deploying with the free trial](#deploying-with-minimal-costs).
* **Azure account permissions**:
  * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner). If you don't have subscription-level permissions, you must be granted [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview) for an existing resource group and [deploy to that existing group](#existing-resource-group).
  * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

In order to run the notebooks in this example repository, you'll need:
* **Azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service**. You can request access with [this form](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If your access request to Azure OpenAI service doesn't match the [acceptance criteria](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext), you can use [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) instead. Learn [how to switch to an OpenAI instance](#openaicom-openai).

## Azure deployment

### Cost estimation

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
However, you can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/8ffbe5b1919c4c72aed89b022294df76) for the resources below.

- Azure App Service: Basic Tier with 1 CPU core, 1.75 GB RAM. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/linux/)
- Azure OpenAI: Standard tier, ChatGPT models. Pricing per 1K tokens used, and at least 1K tokens are used per question. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
- Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for various services, but those SKUs have limitations.
See this guide on [deploying with minimal costs](#deploy-lowcost) for more details.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Project setup

#### Local environment

First install the required tools:

* [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
* [Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
* [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
  * **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell terminal. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

Then bring down the project code:

1. Create a new folder and switch to it in the terminal
1. Run `azd auth login`
1. Run `azd init -t https://github.com/mattgotteiner/AI-Chat-App-Hack-Vision`
    * note that this command will initialize a git repository and you do not need to clone this repository

### Deploying from scratch

Execute the following command, if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
    * **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.

> NOTE: It may take 5-10 minutes for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen or an error page, then wait a bit and refresh the page.

### Deploying with existing Azure resources

If you already have existing Azure resources, you can re-use those by setting `azd` environment values.

#### Existing resource group

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_LOCATION {Location of existing resource group}`

#### Existing Azure AI Search resource

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE {Name of existing Azure AI Search service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group with ACS service}`
1. If that resource group is in a different location than the one you'll pick for the `azd up` step,
  then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_LOCATION {Location of existing service}`
1. If the search service's SKU is not standard, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_SKU {Name of SKU}`. If you specify the free tier, it will use keys instead of managed identity for accessing the search service. Be advised that [search SKUs cannot be changed](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-sku-tier#tier-upgrade-or-downgrade). ([See other possible SKU values](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.search/searchservices?pivots=deployment-language-bicep#sku))
1. If you have an existing index that is set up with all the expected fields, then run `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX {Name of existing index}`. Otherwise, the `azd up` command will create a new index

#### Existing OpenAI resource
Only applies when you are running the notebooks

##### Azure OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE {Name of existing OpenAI service}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP {Name of existing resource group that OpenAI service is provisioned to}`
1. Run `azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT {Name of existing ChatGPT deployment}`. Only needed if your ChatGPT deployment is not the default 'chat'.

##### Openai.com OpenAI:

1. Run `azd env set OPENAI_HOST openai`
2. Run `azd env set OPENAI_ORGANIZATION {Your OpenAI organization}`
3. Run `azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY {Your OpenAI API key}`

You can retrieve your OpenAI key by checking [your user page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your organization by navigating to [your organization page](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).
Learn more about creating an OpenAI free trial at [this link](https://openai.com/pricing).
Do *not* check your key into source control.

#### Other existing Azure resources

You can also use existing Storage Accounts. See `./infra/main.parameters.json` for list of environment variables to pass to `azd env set` to configure those existing resources.

#### Provision remaining resources

Now you can run `azd up`, following the steps in [Deploying from scratch](#deploying-from-scratch) above.
That will both provision resources and deploy the code.

### Deploying again

If you've only changed the backend/frontend code in the `app` folder, then you don't need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can just run:

```azd deploy```

If you've changed the infrastructure files (`infra` folder or `azure.yaml`), then you'll need to re-provision the Azure resources. You can do that by running:

```azd up```

## Deploying with minimal costs

This sample application is designed to be easily deployed using the Azure Developer CLI, which provisions the infrastructure according to the Bicep files in the `infra` folder. Those files describe each of the Azure resources needed, and configures their SKU (pricing tier) and other parameters. Many Azure services offer a free tier, but the infrastructure files in this project do *not* default to the free tier as there are often limitations in that tier.

However, if your goal is to minimize costs while prototyping your application, follow these steps below _before_ deploying the application.

[📺 Live stream: Deploying from a free account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlIyos0RXHw)

1. Create a new azd environment for the free resource group:

    ```shell
    azd env new
    ```

    Enter a name that will be used for the resource group.
    This will create a new folder in the `.azure` folder, and set it as the active environment for any calls to `azd` going forward.

2. Use the free tier of App Service:

    ```shell
    azd env set AZURE_APP_SERVICE_SKU F1
    ```

    Limitation: You are only allowed a certain number of free App Service instances per region. If you have exceeded your limit in a region, you will get an error during the provisioning stage. If that happens, you can run `azd down`, then `azd env new` to create a new environment with a new region.

3. Use the free tier of Azure AI Search:

    ```shell
    azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_SKU free
    ```

    Limitations:
    1. You are only allowed one free search service across all regions.
    If you have one already, either delete that service or follow instructions to
    reuse your [existing search service](../README.md#existing-azure-ai-search-resource).
    2. The free tier does not support Managed Identity (keyless API access).

4. Use OpenAI.com instead of Azure OpenAI: This is only a necessary step for Azure free/student accounts, as they do not currently have access to Azure OpenAI.

    ```shell
    azd env set OPENAI_HOST openai
    azd env set OPENAI_ORGANIZATION {Your OpenAI organization}
    azd env set OPENAI_API_KEY {Your OpenAI API key}
    ```

    Both Azure OpenAI and openai.com OpenAI accounts will incur costs, based on tokens used,
    but the costs are fairly low for the amount of sample data (less than $10).

5. Once you've made the desired customizations, follow the steps in [to run `azd up`](../README.md#deploying-from-scratch). We recommend using "eastus" as the region, for availability reasons.


## Running locally

You can only run locally **after** having successfully run the `azd up` command. If you haven't yet, follow the steps in [Azure deployment](#azure-deployment) above.

1. Run `azd auth login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` to start the project locally.

## Using the app

* In Azure: navigate to the Azure WebApp deployed by azd. The URL is printed out when azd completes (as "Endpoint"), or you can find it in the Azure portal.
* Running locally: navigate to 127.0.0.1:50505

Once in the web app:

* Issue a text-based search related to terms you'd find in pictures about nature (example: `majestic`, `beach`). Observe if the images returned are related to your query

## Clean up

To clean up all the resources created by this sample:

1. Run `azd down`
2. When asked if you are sure you want to continue, enter `y`
3. When asked if you want to permanently delete the resources, enter `y`

The resource group and all the resources will be deleted.
